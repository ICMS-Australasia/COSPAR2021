    <div class="collapse" id="one">
      <div class="faqs-card-body">We are delighted to advise that abstracts have re-opened for a short period of time.  You can submit an abstract for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid until Monday 5 October 2020. <strong>The opportunity to submit new abstracts to the existing program has been provided</strong> in order to allow the members of the community previously unable to attend Sydney in 2020 in-person to now participate in the global COSPAR-2021-Hybrid event. After new abstracts are submitted, the relevant MSO and DO and the Program Committee will review the abstracts and determine how they can be accommodated within the existing program, or, given the flexibility that is provided by a hybrid Assembly, whether an extension of the Event or an additional Event is required.</div>

      <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>How do I give my presentation if I can’t attend in-person?</div>
    <div class="collapse" id="four">
      <div class="faqs-card-body"><strong>All presentations will be pre-recorded by presenters</strong>, with the duration consistent as per the original program timings. These will need to be uploaded for inclusion in the virtual conference delivery platform and will be available at the beginning of the Assembly, searchable according to COSPAR Commissions and Panels, technical themes, and keywords, to registered delegates only.</div>

      <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>How will the Program work in varying time zones?</div>
    <div class="collapse" id="five">
      <div class="faqs-card-body"><strong>The program schedule is designed to deliver the full program across global time zones.</strong> Instead of the oral program on any given day being delivered as parallel quarter-day sessions of consecutive 15-30 minute live talks, spread out over the Australian (and Asian) working day hours and thus representing significant strain for international delegates in different time zones, the program for each day will be concentrated into a three-hour block early in the Australian/Asian day (suitable for the American time zones), and repeated again at the end of the Australian/Asian day and into the evening (suitable for the European, African, and Middle-Eastern time zones). In this way, <strong>all time zones will be catered for</strong>.</div>

      <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>How does the three hour block work?</div>
    <div class="collapse" id="six">
      <div class="faqs-card-body">Each three-hour block will be divided into four 45-minute quarters, representing the original parallel quarter-day sessions for that day. Each 45-minute session will begin with the short summary versions of the presentations in the order in which they have been designated for that session in the program. These can be delivered either live streamed by the presenter or by streaming the pre-recorded version, at the option of the presenter. Following the delivery of these summary presentations, live and interactive Q&A will be enabled via the platform and moderated by the session chair (selected by the Event MSO and DO). The three-hour block will be repeated later that day.</div>

    <div class="collapse" id="seven">
      <div class="faqs-card-body">Presenters will be invited to deliver their summary presentation and answer questions in either or both of the three-hour blocks on their allocated day, either interactively as a live stream or utilising their pre-recording. The Q&A content will be captured, flow from the first block to the second and be maintained as a thread throughout the event and beyond.</div>

        <strong>The delivery of posters will be handled virtually</strong>, in a similar manner to the oral presentations, but maintaining a sense of the atmosphere of poster session gatherings.
<ul>
  <li>Each poster presentation will be pre-recorded in the short summary form, including a single-slide version of the poster itself.</li>
  <li>The pre-recording and slide will be available via the platform throughout the Assembly.</li>
  <li>On the relevant day for each programmed poster session, those sessions will be delivered virtually following the three-hour oral blocks.</li>
  <li>The platform will present to the delegates the full array of posters for that session as thumbnails of each slide.</li>
  <li>Clicking on a poster thumbnail will stream the summary presentation for that poster, while an adjacent link will take the delegate into a unique live break-out room with the poster presenter and other interested delegates, and interaction with the presenter and amongst those other delegates will be enabled.</li>
