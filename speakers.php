            <h2>New High Energy Astrophysics Involving Gravitational Waves and Satellite Observations</h2>

            <p>A new exploration of the Universe has recently started through gravitational-wave observations. On September 14, 2015, the first detection of gravitational waves from the coalescence of a binary system of black holes by the Advanced LIGO detectors marked the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy. On August 17, 2017, the first observation of gravitational waves from the inspiral and merger of a binary neutron-star system by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo network, followed 1.7 s later by a weak short gamma-ray burst detected by the Fermi and INTEGRAL satellites initiated the most extensive world-wide observing campaign which led to the detection of multi-wavelength electromagnetic counterparts. Multi-messenger discoveries are revealing the enigmas of the most energetic transients in the sky, probing relativistic astrophysics, nuclear physics, nucleosynthesis, and cosmology. The talk will give an overview of the astrophysical implications of the gravitational-wave and multi-messenger observations, focusing on the key role of multi-wavelength satellites operating together with the current and future gravitational-wave detectors.</p>
            <p>Marica is president of the commission of Gravitational Wave Astrophysics of the International Astronomical Union and member of the Gravitational Wave International Committee. She is member of the Virgo Collaboration, where she coordinated the LIGO and Virgo collaboration electromagnetic follow-up program from 2014 to 2018. She was in the panel that announced the first gravitational-wave signal from the coalescence of two neutron stars at the NSF international press-release. She was listed in  “Nature’s 10” as one of the most impactful scientists of the year 2017. Her scientific interest lies in the (astro)physics governing emission, formation and evolution of black holes and neutron stars. Her research activity is aimed at developing the multi-messenger astronomy, which uses electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations to probe the physics of the most energetic transient phenomena in the Universe.</p>

            <h2>Climate Change, the Ocean, the Cryosphere and Regional Sea-level Change</h2>

            <p>Climate change has become one of the most important economic, environmental and social challenges of the 21st century, with sea-level rise a key aspect. Today, the order of 100 million of people live within a metre of high tide level, and more people are moving towards the coast in both the developed and developing world. Historical and paleo observations, the advent of modern satellite and in situ ocean, cyosphere and climate observing systems and the development of improved ocean, ice sheet and climate models has greatly improved our understanding of contemporary sea-level change. There is now a reasonable understanding of the reasons for sea-level change over recent decades and since 1900, including the attribution of the observed change to the climatic drivers. There are important implication for the 21st century and beyond. Critically important for regional sea level around the globe is the changing structure of the oceans and glaciers, the role of the oceans and atmosphere in the future of the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland and the vertical movement of coastal regions. Projections for the 21st century indicate sea levels could rise by a metre or more for unmitigated emissions. Sea levels will not stop rising in 2100, even for the strongest mitigation scenario. Indeed, failure to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions will lead to a world of catastrophic changes. Avoiding these changes will require significant, urgent and sustained mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. But even with successful mitigation, society will have to adapt to that component of climate change we cannot avoid. As a result, sea-level rise will have major impacts around the world.</p>

            <h2>New aspects of the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn</h2>

            <p>The focus for the search for liquid water within our solar system has expanded in the last 20 years to include the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Our understanding of the magnetospheres of these two planets and their moons has greatly increased following the orbital spacecraft missions at these two giant planets. This orbital exploration began with the Galileo spacecraft at Jupiter from 1995-2003, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft at Saturn from 2004-2017 and the Juno spacecraft which began its orbital tour at Jupiter in 2016. Discoveries from all of these orbital planetary missions will be described as well as comparisons made between the two giant systems.</p>

Microwave discharge ion engines, which were invented and developed by Dr Kuninaka, took Hayabusa explorer on a round-trip journey between Earth and an asteroid from 2003 to 2010. The engines also have been propelling Hayabusa2 explorer toward another asteroid since 2014.</p>

            <h2>The Status of Hayabusa 2 Asteroid Explorer and Its Results</h2>

            <p>JAXA has completed the space mission of Hayabusa asteroid sample return from 2003 to 2010. The retrieved capsule contained a lot of particles originating from the S-type asteroid Itokawa. Hayabusa 2 project was initiated in 2011 for the sample return from a C-type asteroid Ryugu. The bus system is designed more robustly than the original. The spacecraft was launched by H2A rocket December 2014 and then achieved rendezvous with the asteroid in June 2018 after the orbital maneuver by ion engines in 3.5 years. Three robots of MINERVAs and MSCOT successfully landed on and sent back pictures of the asteroid surface in close-up.</p>
            <p>The detail localization and mapping of the surface identified several points for the touch-down and the sample collection. On February 2019 Hayabusa 2 bravely tried the first touch-down and scattered a lot of fragments, some of which might be collected by Hayabusa 2, from the surface. The spacecraft fired the impactor and made an artificial crater with 10m diameter in April 2019. The second touch-down was executed beside the new crater in July. Hayabusa 2 will come back Earth at Woomera Australia on December 2020.</p>

            <h2>The Earth-Moon System:  Our Past, Present, and Future</h2>

            <p>It has been 50 years now since a human first stepped on another planetary body and began exploration of a totally new environment. Some remember that initial step as a once-in-a lifetime event that brought a dramatic change of perspective and understanding. To others it represents just a waypoint in history that occurred two generations in the past. Regardless of how that first venture from the Earth to the Moon is viewed, the space science world of today is quite different from that of 50 years ago. The number of space faring nations participating in exploration has greatly expanded, and the community is irreversibly international in nature, talents, and objectives.  Technical capabilities of instruments and sensors have improved exponentially and will continue to push new boundaries, pose new questions, and stumble upon profound surprises. What have we learned about our home through exploration of the Moon? Are we prepared for the next 50 years?</p>
            <p>The Past. We now know that the Earth and Moon have been intimately linked since our violent origin billions of years ago. The Moon’s surface documents the subsequent formative period of the Earth-Moon system and provides a lasting record of that early era, one that has long since been transformed and lost on Earth.</p>
            <p>The Present. Similarly, we recognize that the Earth and the Moon will continue to uniquely share the same environment at 1 AU. This includes the same ongoing interaction with the residual flux of large and small pieces of solar system debris. The Earth and Moon are also both simultaneously awash in the Sun’s variable magnetic environment and each faces the same amount of energetic solar and galactic plasma and neutral particles.</p>
            <p>The Future. Humanity inhabits all continents of Earth, albeit with different degrees of comfort and prosperity. To meet more of humanity’s vital needs and demands (which will only grow) in the next century, the Moon presents a newly accessible “8th continent” for future exploration as well as potential resources. We must plan carefully and proceed wisely.</p>
