        <p>Australia is buzzing with space conversations. With a new Australian Space Agency (ASA), there’s a momentous research push, an explosion of space-related start-ups and more opportunities than ever for young Australian’s to be part of the journey.</p>
        <p>COSPAR-K is a FREE Space STEM Event that will run in partnership with the NSW Department of Education’s <a href="https://sispprogram.schools.nsw.gov.au/" target="_blank">STEM Industry School Partnerships (SISP) Program</a> alongside the Scientific Assembly (COSPAR 2021). This dedicated STEM Park will feature an array of interactive experiences and activations specially designed for students, teachers and parents to get hands on and participate in. Industry and government partners will provide opportunities to discover the latest innovations and also provide fun through exploration. We want COSPAR-K to be the space to ignite passion in our future thinkers and leaders.</p>
        <p>As the world’s leading space researchers and industries are coming to Australia in January 2021, there exists a once-in-a-generation opportunity to spark the next generation of STEM talent!</p>

        <p>The skills that learning about Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) bring will be the foundation of the future world economy. These skills, along with enterprise skills such as creativity, critical thinking and digital
          literacy will be the key to creating a world-leading future workforce in Australia. 50 years on from humankind’s first steps on the Moon, the value of an inspired STEM generation is reflected in our daily lives.</p>
        <p>STEM education is critically important for Australia, as over the past decade there has been strong demand requiring workforce skills in STEM areas, while at the same time there has been a fall in students studying these subjects at high
          school and university. The time for better engagement is now. COSPAR-K provides this opportunity.</p>
        <p>COSPAR 2021 is making a deliberate effort to reach out to and motivate young people to pursue STEM careers that will contribute to Australia's evolving high-tech economy as a lasting legacy of this Assembly.</p>
