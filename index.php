        <p>In light of the advice from the Australian Federal Government and with the current travel bans and need to safeguard our space research community at large, COSPAR 2021 will continue as planned, but with the addition of a major on-line
          component enabling the Assembly to become a hybrid in-person / virtual event.</p>
        <p>The Assembly will still be held at the same venue, the International Convention Centre Sydney, from Thursday 28 January 2021 through to Thursday 4 February 2021.</p>
        <p>The very extensive and indeed excellent program that our Scientific Program Committee assembled for COSPAR-2020 will be carried over to the new dates, along with the line-up of inspirational international and national speakers, the
          interdisciplinary workshops, as well as immersive social opportunities.</p>
        <p>We are developing an approach that guarantees that every Interdisciplinary Speaker, oral presentation, poster presentation and workshop will occur at least once in a time zone friendly to attendees. Presentations will be a mix of in-person
          presentations from Sydney, live streaming and pre-recorded sessions.</p>
        <p>The new hybrid format will enable all presenters to have the unique opportunity of sharing their science to a much broader audience. COSPAR 2021 in-person attendees will follow the current program as scheduled.</p>
        <p>The COSPAR community is well-positioned to respond positively to the changing environment and to utilise collaborative technology and with that, have wider access to information and a global research base. The ability to combine our
          traditional in-person meeting with an online virtual forum means that location, distance and isolation is now less of a barrier for participation. The preparations for this will enable full flexibility over the balance of virtual and
          in-person, in step with the uncertainties around COVID. Knowledge-sharing will remain the cornerstone of the Assembly and your engagement and contributions will be paramount to the success of the delivery. Heightening your experience will
          include the legacy of all sessions being recorded and uploaded as on-demand content; allowing you to experience all sessions, as you desire, and extending the value, impact and legacy of the worldâ€™s largest and leading space research forum
          and community.</p>
        <p>We look forward to continuing to increase these outcomes as we adapt to the shifting events landscape and the global impact for our COSPAR space community. Rather than settle for a low-key Assembly under the constraints of COVID, we are
          excited about embracing the future and making the gathering even more successful than previously imagined.</p>
        <p>As planning evolves, we will make regular announcements, via the website and social media platforms <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CommitteeOnSpaceResearch/?ref=bookmarks" target="_blank"
            style="color:#0c4da2;">@CommitteeonSpaceResearch</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/russell-boyce-935ab01a/?originalSubdomain=au" style="color:#0c4da2;" target="_blank">@LinkedIn</a>, providing the virtual participants in
          COSPAR-2021 with all the information they need to enjoy the Assembly to the fullest.</p>
        <p>We are committed to ensuring that the health and safety of all of our speakers, sponsors, exhibitors, delegates and stakeholders is prioritised above all else. Together we look forward to hosting COSPAR 2021 and in delivering a successful
          and impactful Assembly, remembered for many years to come.</p>
        <p>Thanks for your confidence and your support.</p>

        <p style="font-size:1.1em;">The details below are intended to provide required information to everyone associated with the Scientific Program for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid: the authors of all accepted abstracts, the Main Scientific Organizers (MSOs) of all scientific events, the Chairs of Scientific Commissions and Panels, and the COSPAR Program Committee. The information describes how each scientific session will be delivered for participation worldwide, and describes how poster sessions will be conducted and the responsibilities of poster presenters. All virtual presenters will be well assisted in preparing for and participating in COSPAR-2021-Hybrid. The plans for Assembly-wide events such as interdisciplinary lectures are provided, as well as preliminary information, where available, on related events such as cross-disciplinary workshops, career fairs, etc., that will be held in conjunction with the Assembly. A summary is provided of the opportunities that are available in COSPAR-2021-Hybrid for the virtual and in-person participants, as well as the approach that is being taken to registration fees in this hybrid context. Finally, the key dates between now and the Assembly are outlined.</p>
