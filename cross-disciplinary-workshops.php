                            <p>Ryan is a physical oceanographer who studies the large-scale ocean circulation and its relationship with Earth's climate. A central theme is how ocean mesoscale turbulence, i.e. eddies, waves, and jets on scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers, contributes to the transport of momentum, heat, and geochemically relevant tracers. Regionally, his main focus is the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica and links the three main ocean basins. High-resolution numerical modeling and satellite remote sensing are key tools in this research, which has led to an interest in high performance computing and big data. Prof. Abernathey helps lead the Pangeo project, an international collaboration aimed at accelerating data-intensive geoscience research through open source software and open infrastructure. He is a core developer of several open source scientific python libraries, including Xarray, Zarr, and Xgcm.</p>
