        <h2>New Landing Dates</h2>

        <p>The leadership of COSPAR and the Local Organizing Committee for COSPAR 2020 in Sydney, Australia have concluded that with the worldwide pandemic and accompanying social and economic disruption, COSPAR 2020 must be postponed.
        </p>
        <p><strong>The new dates for the 43rd COSPAR Scientific Assembly will be 28 January – 4 February 2021 and hereafter will be referred to as COSPAR 2021.</strong></p>
        <p>The extensive planning and preparations for COSPAR 2020 are completely transferable to the new dates, by which time we anticipate that the thirst for knowledge and personal collaboration throughout the global space research community can
          and will be met with an extremely successful COSPAR Scientific Assembly in Australia.</p>
        <p>We sincerely hope that the entire COSPAR community is able to remain healthy and that the extraordinary efforts underway to contain the coronavirus and preserve economic security are successful.</p>
        <p class="last">In the meantime, let’s continue to work together virtually so that we ensure a Sydney summer in January 2021 will both brighten our outlook and continue our cause of promoting and facilitating international cooperation and
          advances in space research.</p>
