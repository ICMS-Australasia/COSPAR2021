        <p><strong>COSPAR-2021-Hybrid will be held from 28 January 2021 to 4 February 2021 will be Hybrid – a blend of in-person in Sydney, Australia and virtual (both interactive and on-demand). As a consequence of COVID-19 and Australian government restrictions on travel, it is likely that only Australian residents will be able to attend in person.</strong></p>

        <p>Even with these changes occurring in all organizations around the globe, the organizers of COSPAR-2021-Hybrid are fully committed and prepared to view this an opportunity for COSPAR and offer a global gathering that is stimulating and rewarding, with far more opportunities for engagement with each other and for more access to content than is normally possible in a large in-person Assembly. Indeed, lessons in 2021 will be applied to future COSPAR Assemblies. A reasonable expectation is that in the future hybrid conferences, with varying levels of in-person and virtual participation, will remain an attractive option for many, and COSPAR is fully prepared to offer the best possible hybrid event.</p>
        <p>In recognition that most participants in COSPAR-2021-Hybrid will do so in the virtual sense, all aspects of the scientific program will be delivered such that they can be accessed virtually. At the same time, in-person participation will be seamlessly integrated into the delivery.</p>
        <p>This document is intended to provide you with details of how the Scientific Program for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid will be conducted, of your opportunities and responsibilities for participating in the Scientific Program and of your opportunity for a reduced registration rate in return for on-time delivery of pre-recorded presentations.</p>
        <p>The Scientific Program for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid is the program for COSPAR 2020, shifted from August to 28 January until 4 February, the new dates of COSPAR-2021-Hybrid. The only difference, as explained below, is how the program will be offered, so that COSPAR-2021-Hybrid will be a truly global Assembly, with full participation in multiple time zones. Also included below is information on how interdisciplinary and other Assembly-wide events will be held, on technical support that will be provided to virtual presenters, as well as summaries of the opportunities available for virtual and for in-person participants. All of these should convince you that COSPAR-2021-Hybrid will be an outstanding Assembly.</p>

        <p class="first">The details below are intended to provide required information to everyone associated with the Scientific Program for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid: the authors of all accepted abstracts, the Main Scientific Organizers (MSOs) of all scientific events, the Chairs of Scientific Commissions and Panels, and the COSPAR Program Committee. The information describes how each scientific session will be delivered for participation worldwide, and describes how poster sessions will be conducted and the responsibilities of poster presenters. All virtual presenters will be well assisted in preparing for and participating in COSPAR-2021-Hybrid. The plans for Assembly-wide events such as interdisciplinary lectures are provided, as well as preliminary information, where available, on related events such as cross-disciplinary workshops, career fairs, etc., that will be held in conjunction with the Assembly. A summary is provided of the opportunities that are available in COSPAR-2021-Hybrid for the virtual and in-person participants, as well as the approach that is being taken to registration fees in this hybrid context. Finally, the key dates between now and the Assembly are outlined.</p>


        <h3>1. The Basics for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid</h3>
        <ul class="alpha list-space">
          <li>The Scientific Program (dates, sessions and selected contributions) that was initially released for COSPAR 2020 and then transplanted to 2021 is the Scientific Program for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid.</li>
          <li>Existing abstracts in the Scientific Program can be updated and the program can expand with new abstracts and presenters.</li>
          <li>The current challenges will be viewed as opportunities to innovate and demonstrate the art of the possible for large gatherings in the new world we find ourselves in.</li>
          <li>COSPAR-2021-Hybrid will contribute to COSPAR’s mission by bringing the space research community together to connect, share, partner and grow, evermore successfully.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. COSPAR-2021-Hybrid, a true global Assembly</h3>

        <p>The following are the activities and actions that will occur to deliver a Scientific Program for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid that can be enjoyed, with active participation, worldwide. These activities and actions apply to the Scientific Program, which was established for COSPAR-2021, when it was postponed from COSPAR 2020. There is no change in the program (themes, sessions, layout), now that COSPAR-2021 is COSPAR-2021-Hybrid. </p>

        <ul class="list-space">
          <li><strong>The abstract submission portal will be re-opened after release of this document</strong>, to allow authors whose content may have evolved in the period of the delay from 2020 to 2021 to update their abstracts, subject to maintaining the essential theme of the presentation and relevance to the Event in which they have already been scheduled.</li>
          <li><strong>An opportunity to submit new abstracts to the existing program will be provided</strong> in order to allow the members of the community previously unable to attend Sydney in 2020 in person to now participate in the global COSPAR-2021-Hybrid event. After new abstracts are submitted, the relevant MSO and DO and the Program Committee will review the abstracts and determine how they can be accommodated within the existing program, or, given the flexibility that is provided by a hybrid Assembly, whether an extension of the Event or an additional Event is required.</li>
          <li><strong>All presentations will be pre-recorded by presenters</strong>, with the duration consistent as per the original program timings. These will need to be uploaded for inclusion in the virtual conference delivery platform and will be available at the beginning of the Assembly, searchable according to COSPAR Commissions and Panels, technical themes, and keywords, to registered delegates only.</li>
          <li><strong>A short (few minutes, with exact duration to be advised), single-slide summary presentation will also be pre-recorded and uploaded by each presenter.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The program schedule is designed to deliver the full program across global time zones.</strong> Instead of the oral program on any given day being delivered as parallel quarter-day sessions of consecutive 15-30 minute live talks, spread out over the Australian (and Asian) working day hours and thus representing significant strain for international delegates in different time zones, the program for each day will be concentrated into a three-hour block early in the Australian/Asian day (suitable for the American time zones), and repeated again at the end of the Australian/Asian day and into the evening (suitable for the European, African, and Middle-Eastern time zones). In this way, <strong>all time zones will be catered for</strong>.</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Each three-hour block will be divided into four 45-minute quarters, representing the original parallel quarter-day sessions for that day. Each 45-minute session will begin with the short summary versions of the presentations in the order in which they have been designated for that session in the program. These can be delivered either live-streamed by the presenter or by streaming the pre-recorded version, at the option of the presenter. Following the delivery of these summary presentations, live and interactive Q&A will be enabled via the platform and moderated by the session chair (selected by the Event MSO and DO). The three-hour block will be repeated later that day.</li>
              <li>Presenters will be invited to deliver their summary presentation and answer questions in either or both of the three-hour blocks on their allocated day, either interactively as a live stream or utilising their pre-recording. The Q&A content will be captured, flow from the first block to the second and be maintained as a thread throughout the event and beyond.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><strong>The delivery of posters will be handled virtually</strong>, in a similar manner to the oral presentations, but maintaining a sense of the atmosphere of poster session gatherings.</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Each poster presentation will be pre-recorded in the short summary form, including a single-slide version of the poster itself.</li>
              <li>The pre-recording and slide will be available via the platform throughout the Assembly.</li>
              <li>On the relevant day for each programmed poster session, those sessions will be delivered virtually following the three-hour oral blocks.</li>
              <li>The platform will present to the delegates the full array of posters for that session as thumbnails of each slide.</li>
              <li>Clicking on a poster thumbnail will stream the summary presentation for that poster, while an adjacent link will take the delegate into a unique live break-out room with the poster presenter and other interested delegates, and interaction with the presenter and amongst those other delegates will be enabled.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><strong>The on-line platform, which will be available to both in-person and virtual participants</strong>, will include personalised tailoring options to highlight to each participant the content and the other participants and participating organisations that might be of specific relevance and interest to them and enable direct connections to be easily made. With the use of the platform, the ‘corridor conversations’ that are so valuable for building relationship and partnership will be enabled – assisted by virtual meeting rooms - and in fact enhanced.</li>
        </ul>



        <h3>3. Technical support for virtual participants in COSPAR-2021-Hybrid.</h3>

        <p>The Professional Conference Organizer (PCO) for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid is ICMS Australasia (ICMSA), whose Digital Event Team will arrange for, implement, manage and execute the complex and comprehensive communications systems that will be employed for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid. ICMSA has extensive experience in successful hybrid conferences, and it is for this reason that COSPAR is confident that COSPAR-2021-Hybrid will be a success. Specifically, the ICMSA Digital Team will assist all participants in COSPAR-2021-Hybrid as follows.</p>

        <ul class="list-space">
          <li><strong>Preparing presentations.</strong> The Digital Event Team will assist presenters and ensure materials are “presentation-ready”. Presenters will receive instructions by mid-October 2020 on how to format and upload their presentations to the virtual event platform. From the virtual speakers’ preparation room, presenters will know when they need to be available online to present and or participate in live Q&A.</li>
          <li><strong>Live streaming.</strong> For Live Streamed content, the conference center ICC Sydney will build a broadcast studio to help deliver both digitally and in-person. On-site and offsite speakers can connect – streaming to offsite audiences. Local presenters wishing to meet and present in-person (pending final decision on the hybrid balance) can attend onsite and participate in the Q&A while it streams to all delegates, as well as follow the Q&A thread for each presentation as it evolves online over the remainder of the Assembly.</li>
          <li><strong>Pre-Briefing for speakers.</strong> Session Chairs, Interdisciplinary Speakers, Oral Presenters, key stakeholders and guest speakers will all be pre-briefed on interacting with both the in-person and online audiences.</li>
          <li><strong>Moderating and Facilitating the Conversations Outside Events.</strong> A dedicated moderator and a team of facilitators will be provided; making use of online social platforms, to promote participation and allowing COSPAR-2021-Hybrid attendees to connect with each other to a greater degree. The facilitators will act on behalf of the online audiences and will be armed with clear guidelines and procedures to enable them to contribute effectively without causing confusion or disruption.</li>
          <li><strong>New Delivery Methods.</strong> One of the added benefits of hybrid is the opportunity to pre-record content. All presenters will be supported and fully prepared and well-rehearsed, ensuring they are comfortable with the new mode of delivery, and fully understanding how and when they will be seen in an online capacity.</li>

        </ul>




        <h3>4. Interdisciplinary Lectures, cross-disciplinary workshops and Assembly-wide events</h3>

        <p>An outstanding selection of speakers from across the globe will deliver Interdisciplinary Lectures through the on-line platform. All Interdisciplinary Lectures will be live-streamed and feature live moderated Q&A to ensure maximum benefit to the COSPAR scientific community. These Interdisciplinary Lectures will occur prior to the commencement of the main Programming to ensure maximum participation, each day, and also be available as on demand content. Cross-disciplinary workshops, panel events, and public lectures will also be a highlight on the on-line platform.</p>


        <h3>5.	Summary of the benefits of COSPAR-2021-Hybrid, for virtual and in-person delegates</h3>

        <p>The virtual participants in COSPAR-2021-Hybrid will receive </p>

        <ul class="list-space">
          <li>Open Access to all Assembly sessions during 27 January - 4 February 2021, starting 1 day before the Assembly. Log in and out at your convenience.</li>
          <li>Access to 100% of the scientific program. In comparison, the average amount of sessions an in-person delegate will be able to attend is approximately 3 - 5 sessions/hr, resulting in an average of only 8% of the scientific program.</li>
          <li>Access to over 1,000+ hours of space research on-line content. View content as you require, downloadable until the end of 2021 and stored and on viewed on your device for as long as you need.</li>

          <li>Stream live or watch content on demand when it fits into your schedule and learn at your own pace, in your own style.</li>
          <li>Access to on-demand content post-event. The COSPAR-2021-Hybrid on-line library of content will be available up until to the commencement of COSPAR 2022. This allows ample time to view every session presented at COSPAR-2021-Hybrid and re-watch any sessions.</li>
          <li>Pique your interest with other areas of research that you would not otherwise have the time to attend</li>
          <li>On-line engagement opportunities with global space industry personnel, government agencies and commercial representatives will be available.</li>
          <li>Access to pre-Assembly networking on-line.</li>
          <li>In the lead-up to COSPAR-2021-Hybrid we will be hosting special sessions on-line, including specific talks from COSPAR Commissions, industry partners and inter disciplinary speakers.</li>
          <li>Ability to schedule meetings and connect with other COSPAR-2021-Hybrid attendees located anywhere around the globe.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The in-person participants in COSPAR-2021-Hybrid will receive the following benefits:</p>

        <ul class="list-space">
          <li>Access to all Virtual Registration benefits plus the below.</li>
          <li>Admission to all Assembly sessions 27 January - 4 February 2021</li>
          <li>In-person engagement opportunities with Australian space industry personnel, government agencies and commercial representatives</li>

        </ul>


        <h3>6. Registration Fees </h3>

        <p>The above, and much more, will enable a global gathering that is stimulating and rewarding. It will provide far more opportunities for engagement with each other and for access to content than is normally possible at a large Assembly. The in-person-related costs associated with running the event will naturally go down significantly, but the provision and delivery of technology that pushes the state-of-the-art for global conferences in the face of a pandemic entails significant costs.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the decision has been taken to maintain the full, published registration fee. However, the early bird rate will be extended to the end of December 2020 and of most importance to presenters at COSPAR-2021-Hybrid, a further-reduced registration fee is available for those presenters who comply with the request to submit their pre-recorded contributions by the end of November. Submitting pre-recorded contributions in time to obtain the reduced rate will allow the organizers of COSPAR-2021-Hybrid to populate the on-line platform for seamless content delivery before 28 January 2021.</p>
        <p>Effective with the release of this document, a discounted “Presenters Early Bird Rate” is introduced, that will expire at the end of November 2020. Access to this new rate will be triggered by upload of the presenter’s pre-recordings prior to the end of November.</p>
        <p>Shown in the following Table is a summary of all registration rates.</p>

  <h3>8. Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The re-imagined COSPAR-2021-Hybrid is now filled with unique offerings and benefits that will contribute to COSPAR’s mission by bringing the space research community together to connect, share, partner and grow, even more successfully than before. COSPAR-2021-Hybrid aims to be a global gathering that is stimulating and rewarding, with far more opportunities for engagement with each other than anticipated using the technology that is available to us. Our guiding principles of innovation and exploration will be used to navigate the journey to the delivery of COSPAR-2021-Hybrid and beyond, shaping future Assemblies to the possibilities for a new way of sharing space science and, more generally, space research.</p>
