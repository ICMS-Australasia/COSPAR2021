          <p>Imagine you work with a company that has developed a lunar rover, and you want to compete for a contract with NASA to extract and sell water ice on the Moon. You need a launch partner, and you need to know how your activities on the Moon will be regulated. But what if there is a risk of colliding with space debris during the launch? What if debates at the UN raise concerns about protecting the lunar environment, or about who can share in the benefits of these commercial activities, under the Outer Space Treaty? What is the lawful thing to do, and what is the right thing to do? In this session, space law and ethics experts will talk you through a hypothetical scenario, and you will have the opportunity to ask questions and propose answers.</p>

          <p>What is it like to work in space exploration and specifically on the M2020 Mission?  How did the Australian Adrian Brown make his way from Melbourne to NASA as the Deputy Program Scientist for the Mars 2020 mission? What is the connection between the rocks of Mars and those of the Pilbara in Western Australia and how can our rocks help in the search for life on another planet? This mission is the first part of an ambitious plan to eventually bring samples from Mars back to Earth.</p>
          <p class="last">Here is your opportunity to learn firsthand about M2020 from one of the key NASA scientists. Participants even have the opportunity to ask Dr Brown questions.</p>

        <h2>The Sky is not the Limit: Australia's Future in Space Science</h2>
        <h3 class="last">Tuesday 2 February – FREE for Australian Attendees at the Town Hall</h3>
        <h4 class="first">AEDT 14:00 – 15:30</h4>
        <p><b>Speakers/Presenters: Emeritus Professor Fred Menk, Professor Phil Bland and Imogen Rea. </b></p>
        <p>A new strategic plan for Australian space science has been under development for some time on behalf of the Australian Academy of Science. This has been informed by several expert working groups, surveys, and other consultation. This session will provide opportunity for public comment on the draft Plan.</p>
        <p>Our society is increasingly dependent on space derived services, while the burgeoning pace of space activity will unleash new opportunities and risks. The Plan outlines a framework for space science to advance Australia’s interests and priorities by contributing to discovery and innovation, the economy, security, society, and the workforce. Space science is a fundamental enabler for space industry and applications, and Australia’s world-class expertise in space science is critical for effectively leveraging these opportunities and mitigating risks.</p>
        <p>This is the opportunity to provide constructive feedback helping shape the Plan for the benefit of all Australians.</p>
        <p>Of course, you don’t have to watch it all at once with the main benefit of COSPAR 2021 being that all the content is available for 12 months after the live event runs.</p>
        <p>There is still ample time to connect with the world’s largest space research Assembly.</p>
