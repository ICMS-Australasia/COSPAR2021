          <h3>Machine Learning for Space Sciences</h3>
        <p>The widespread availability of machine learning (ML) technologies promises to disrupt scientific disciplines.</p>
        <p>Popular open source ML frameworks are not only useful for data-driven model fitting, but also for efficient computation of physics-based models. This COSPAR 2021 workshop is dedicated to showcasing use cases of ML technologies to observational and simulation data. <b>This includes applications to:</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>satellite imagery classification and image restoration (including super-resolution)</li>
          <li>space weather prediction</li>
          <li>exoplanet detection and characterization</li>
          <li>astrophysical simulations</li>

          <h3>Autonomy for Future Space Science Missions</h3>
        <p>The rise of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques is creating opportunities for space science missions with unprecedented capabilities. By augmenting traditional rule-based decision making with AI techniques (such as decision policies in deep reinforcement learning), robotic missions may become highly autonomous. Furthermore, ML advances will augment the capabilities of crews serving in extended space missions. <b>Questions to be explored in this COSPAR 2021 Workshop include:</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>How will ML/AI enable autonomous space science missions?</li>
          <li>What platforms are available for low-power, high-throughput compute in space?</li>
          <li>How can advances in ML augment human capabilities in crewed missions?</li>
        </ol>

          <h3>Cloud Computing for Space Research</h3>
          <p>As space becomes increasingly accessible due to the burgeoning global space industry, the volume of data produced by space research missions is expected to continue rising exponentially.</p>
          <p>Opportunities for accelerating scientific discovery come with challenges in scaling traditional scientific processing workflows. A possible model for addressing such needs is the adoption of cloud compute technologies and open source software. At the same time, the deployment of cloud compute technologies can allow researchers to address calls for scientific reproducibility.</p>
          <p><b>This COSPAR 2021 workshop will include tutorials and case studies addressing the following questions:</b></p>

        <ol>
          <li>What cloud compute offerings are available for space researchers to develop workflows?</li>
          <li>How can we use open source software and cloud compute to massively scale scientific data processing?</li>
          <li>How can scientists equip ourselves with the skills to take advantage of these technologies?</li>
          <li>How can cloud compute and web technologies be used to engage the public in citizen science and for enhancing STEAM* education?</li>

          <p>Imagine you work with a company that has developed a lunar rover, and you want to compete for a contract with NASA to extract and sell water ice on the Moon. You need a launch partner, and you need to know how your activities on the Moon will be regulated. But what if there is a risk of colliding with space debris during the launch? What if debates at the UN raise concerns about protecting the lunar environment, or about who can share in the benefits of these commercial activities, under the Outer Space Treaty? What is the lawful thing to do, and what is the right thing to do? In this session, space law and ethics experts will talk you through a hypothetical scenario, and you will have the opportunity to ask questions and propose answers.</p>

        <h2>The Sky is not the Limit: Australia's Future in Space Science</h2>
        <h3 class="last">Tuesday 2 February – FREE for Australian Attendees at the Town Hall</h3>
        <h4 class="first">AEDT 14:00 – 15:30</h4>
        <p><b>Speakers/Presenters: Emeritus Professor Fred Menk, Professor Phil Bland and Imogen Rea. </b></p>
        <p>A new strategic plan for Australian space science has been under development for some time on behalf of the Australian Academy of Science. This has been informed by several expert working groups, surveys, and other consultation. This session will provide opportunity for public comment on the draft Plan.</p>
        <p>Our society is increasingly dependent on space derived services, while the burgeoning pace of space activity will unleash new opportunities and risks. The Plan outlines a framework for space science to advance Australia’s interests and priorities by contributing to discovery and innovation, the economy, security, society, and the workforce. Space science is a fundamental enabler for space industry and applications, and Australia’s world-class expertise in space science is critical for effectively leveraging these opportunities and mitigating risks.</p>
        <p>This is the opportunity to provide constructive feedback helping shape the Plan for the benefit of all Australians.</p>
        <p>Of course, you don’t have to watch it all at once with the main benefit of COSPAR 2021 being that all the content is available for 12 months after the live event runs.</p>
        <p>There is still ample time to connect with the world’s largest space research Assembly.</p>
