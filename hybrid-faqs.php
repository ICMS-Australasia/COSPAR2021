        <h2 class="mb-4">What will a Hybrid COSPAR 2021 look like?</h2>

        <p>A hybrid COSPAR will combine a live in-person Assembly with a "virtual" on-line component. In the context of COSPAR 2021 this model represents planning for Australian (possibly New Zealand and other “green lane” countries to Australia)
          delegates to participate in-person at the ICC Sydney. The Program will be delivered via a combination of live streaming sessions as well as the integration of pre-recorded content, streamed at set times to facilitate best outcomes for a
          global audience.</p>

        <p>Importantly for our international delegates, you will be able to experience the full suite of the COSPAR Assembly Program as well as a virtual exhibition and Poster Sessions.</p>

              <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>What is the registration policy for accepted abstracts of authors and presenters?</div>
            <div class="collapse" id="two">
              <div class="faqs-card-body">

                The COSPAR policy remains in place. All presenters must be registered for the Assembly. If multiple co-authors are planning to attend the Assembly, each co-author must register individually. For panels, the requirement is that all
                panellists must be registered.

            <div class="collapse" id="three">
              <div class="faqs-card-body">

                You will not need to download specific software to participate in the event. You will be provided with a web link prior to the commencement of the Assembly to the COSPAR 2021 Virtual Platform. Full on-line support before and during
                the event will be given to all the attendees, speakers, session chairs & exhibitors.

        <h2 class="mb-4">Connecting and Networking</h2>

        <p>Whether COSPAR 2021 delegates are at the ICC, Sydney or participating on-line from around the globe, you are the heart and soul of the Assembly and will be acknowledged as such. The COSPAR 2021 Chair, Session Chairs, Interdisciplinary Speakers, Oral Presenters, key stakeholders and guest speakers will be well briefed on interacting with both audiences and there will be special opportunities for virtual networks to be formed via The Assembly Hub.</p>

              <div class="faqs-card-body"> The Assembly Hub will let you engage in real-time connections with other presenters and attendees via the virtual platform. Attendees will be able to search the Assembly Hub for fellow virtual attendees, request meetings with them and when accepted engage in a video conversation, just like at a live event! </div>

              <div class="faqs-card-body">

                One of the benefits of hosting COSPAR 2021 in hybrid mode is that participants can attend virtually from all over the world. COSPAR 2021 organisers are in the process of finalising the program, whereby we propose adhering to the <a href="program-glance">current program</a>.

                <ul class="mt-3">
                  <li>COSPAR 2021 in-person attendees will follow the current program as scheduled. The presentations will be a mix of in-person presenters, live streaming and pre-recorded sessions.</li>
                  <li>There will also be live and pre-recorded poster sessions and events happening at all hours of the day. The schedule guarantees that every Interdisciplinary Speaker and oral presentation, poster presentation and workshop will occur at least once in a time-friendly to attendees' local time zone.</li>
                  <li>All oral presentations can pre-recorded with the option of live Q&A at the end of the session.</li>
                </ul>

                Over the coming months our Assembly team will be in contact with all presenters to appraise you on the technicalities and requirements of your presentation.

                As all sessions will be recorded and uploaded as on-demand content, the full Assembly Program can be accessed; allowing delegates to experience all sessions, as you desire, a benefit not previously offered.
                <br><br>
We’ll create networking opportunities to add further value to your registration.<br><br>
The Assembly Hub will also house our sponsors and exhibitors, offering a range of benefits to attendees.<br><br>
We’re also planning a COSPAR + Program, offering a range of sessions and speakers never experienced before at a COSPAR Assembly.
