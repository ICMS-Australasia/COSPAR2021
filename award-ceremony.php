                          <p>Professor Dr. John Z. Kiss and Dr. F. Javier Medina have both been active in international spaceflight research for more than two decades during which they studied the growth and development of plants under microgravity in spaceflight.  Both served as principal investigators for a joint spaceflight project named Seeding Growth (SG) where Kiss was funded by NASA and Medina by ESA and the Spanish National Research Agency to conduct studies on board the International Space Station.  The major goals of the Seedling Growth program were to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms and growth. <a href="#kiss-medina" data-toggle="modal">Read more</a></p>

                  <h2>William J. Borucki</h2>
                  <h3>Minor Planet (7864) Borucki</h3>
                  <p>The Kepler mission, which is of fundamental importance for the understanding of our place in the universe, would not have come to fruition without the ingenuity and dedication of William Borucki.  Early in his career, William had distinguished himself by building spectroscopic instrumentation to determine the plasma properties of hypervelocity shock waves.  He developed photochemical models of the Earth's stratosphere and mesosphere to investigate the impact of nitric oxide and fluorocarbon emissions on ozone.  He also investigated the optical efficiency of lightning and used these measurements in conjunction with spacecraft observations to deduce the production rate of prebiological molecules in planetary atmospheres.  But detecting an 80 ppm dimming in a star is a daunting feat, and it took William and his team years to convince the scientific community that this was a feasible method for finding exoplanets.  The resounding success of the resulting Kepler Mission has more than justified his efforts.</p>
                  <p>In his own words “Going from speculation to knowledge is what science is all about”, and William’s career is a testament to his contribution to Science.  He is a worthy recipient of COSPAR’s Space Science Award.</p>

                	<h3>Biography</h3>
                  <p>William Borucki received a MSc in physics from the University of Wisconsin in 1962 and then moved to NASA Ames where he worked on the development of the heat shield for the Apollo Mission. After the successful Moon landings, he transferred to the Theoretical Studies Branch where he investigated lightning activity in planetary atmospheres and developed mathematical models to predict the effects of nitric oxides and chlorofluoromethanes on the Earth’s ozone layer. In 1982 he earned a MSc in meteorology from the California State University. In 1984, he began advocating the development of a space mission that could detect Earth-size planets and determine the frequency of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. In the succeeding years he developed the techniques required to find such small planets and demonstrated that the technology and analysis techniques were sufficiently mature to proceed to flight status.  He served as the Science Principal Investigator for the Kepler Mission which discovered over 4600 planets and planetary candidates. It proved that most stars have planets and small Earth-size planets are common. Borucki retired in 2015 and is now a NASA Ames Associate.</p>

                  <h2>Ken McCracken  </h2>
                  <h3>Minor Planet (8258) McCracken</h3>
                  <p>Dr. Ken McCracken began his career in space science at the University of Tasmania where he developed the four station Australian neutron monitor network for the International Geophysical Year 1957-8.  At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology he developed the mathematics and digital computer code to trace the orbits of relativistic cosmic rays in the six-degree geomagnetic field, a technique still used today.  His studies of the high energy solar proton events in 1960 demonstrated the validity of the Parker model of the heliospheric magnetic field.  Moving to the University of Texas, Dr. McCracken was the principal investigator for cosmic ray anisotropy detectors flown on the interplanetary spacecraft Pioneers 6 through 9 and on earth-orbiting satellites Explorers 34 and 41. These six instruments gave a synoptic view of the radiation at all solar longitudes thereby elucidating the propagation and convection of both solar and galactic cosmic radiation. Returning to Australia in 1966, he established an X-ray astronomy programme using balloons and Skylark rockets launched from the Woomera rocket range. He and his colleagues established that some X-ray objects are strongly time variable. In 1969 he was appointed by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) to establish a laboratory “to apply space technologies to exploration for minerals under the deeply weathered Australian regolith”. He received the CSIRO medal for “Advances in Geophysics”, and was joint recipient of Australia’s most senior scientific award, the “Australia Prize” for this work. He was a member of the Australian Space Board, 1987-92.  Retiring from government service, he has pioneered utilization of the discoveries of the space era in interpretation of ice cores dating 150,000 years into the past. With scientists from several countries he has extrapolated the heliospheric magnetic field and the terrestrial radiation environment throughout the Holocene and beyond.  Dr. McCracken started his scientific career before the commencement of the space era.  His research results over 60 years have been published in more than 100 refereed publications which are well cited by both his contemporaries and younger scientists.  His unique multi-faceted career in cosmic ray and heliospheric research, X-ray astronomy, interplanetary archeology, plus his economically important application of space science and technology to mineral exploration makes him extremely well qualified to receive the COSPAR Space Science Award.</p>

                	<h3>Biography</h3>
                  <p>Ken McCracken was educated in Tasmania and has been a leader in space research ever since. He established an observatory in New Guinea for the International Geophysical Year 1957/8. In 1960 he used cosmic radiation observations and the then largest computer in the world to map the magnetic fields in space. He was the “principal investigator” for radiation instruments flown on four interplanetary “Pioneer” spacecraft to near Mars and Venus and two Earth orbiting “Explorer’ satellites. They provided our modern understanding of the flow of cosmic radiation in space and determined the danger to astronauts and communication satellites from radiation produced in large “solar flares”.   Returning to Australia he and his students flew x-ray astronomy rockets from Woomera. CSIRO appointed him in 1970 to develop a research division “to apply the space technologies to modernise geophysical exploration for minerals in Australia”.  In retirement, he and his wife, Gillian, operated a cattle raising property in the Southern Highlands of NSW. He continues to be deeply involved in space research with colleagues worldwide. Using space measurements and ice cores from Antarctica and Greenland, they have determined the Sun’s influence on space and Earth for the past 150,000 years, and to predict its future effects. His has been a most exciting and adventurous life in the exploration and utilisation of space.</p>

                  <h2>John Kiss and Francisco Javier Medina</h2>
                  <h3>Minor Planet (8267) Kiss	 and Minor Planet (8333) Medina </h3>
                  <p>Professor Dr. John Z. Kiss and Dr. F. Javier Medina have both been active in international spaceflight research for more than two decades during which they studied the growth and development of plants under microgravity in spaceflight.  Both served as principal investigators for a joint spaceflight project named Seeding Growth (SG) where Kiss was funded by NASA and Medina by ESA and the Spanish National Research Agency to conduct studies on board the International Space Station.  The major goals of the Seedling Growth program were to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms and growth.  This successful project was performed between March 2013 and July 2017, using combined American and European technology for the growth of plants in space.  Learning how plants adapt to weightlessness and low-gravity environments is crucial in determining the ability of vegetation to provide a sustainable, dependable, and economical means for human life support in space. The ability of plants to provide a source of food and recycle carbon dioxide into breathable oxygen may prove vital for astronauts who will live in space for months at a time. Finally, in the long term, the new knowledge acquired should lead to significant advances in agriculture on Earth.</p>
                  <p>This International Cooperation Medal to Drs. Kiss and Medina recognizes their pioneering work in space plant sciences with a cooperative spirit at many levels among individuals, organizations, and space agencies. Their achievements epitomize the spirt of this Award, which is to promote people and groups to work together to achieve a common goal and derive mutual benefits in space research.  </p>

                	<h3>Biography</h3>
                  <p>Dr. John Z. Kiss is the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro, and his academic appointment is as Professor of Biology.

                  <h2>Daniel McCleese</h2>
                  <h3>Minor Planet (5641) McCleese</h3>
                  <p>Dr. Daniel J. McCleese is a pioneer in remote sensing of the atmospheres of the terrestrial planets.  Since receiving his doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1976, he has designed, built and flown orbiting, state-of-the-art, remote sounding instruments to profile atmospheric temperatures, aerosols, and constituents, with the ultimate goal of systematically characterizing the atmospheres of Earth, Venus and Mars.  Pursuing his interest in the climates of the terrestrial planets, Dan proposed a small space mission to pursue the observations of the Martian atmosphere which led to NASA initiating a series of planetary missions, the first of which was Mars Observer.  Dan’s instrument team built an atmospheric sounder that combined pressure modulation and filter radiometry to measure temperature, dust and water vapour in the Mars atmosphere using limb sounding.  Space exploration is not for the faint-hearted.  Mars Observer was lost in 1993 just before insertion into orbit around Mars.  Dan’s instrument was selected for the next Mars mission which was also lost on orbit insertion.  The loss of these missions caused NASA to revamp the Mars exploration strategy, and as the Chief Scientist for JPL’s Mars Exploration Program, Dan played a key role in its re-architecting.</p>
                  <p>Dan laid the scientific foundation which resulted in the Opportunity and Spirit rovers, Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the Curiosity rover.  These missions are a result of Dan’s tenacity and vision that have been his trademark throughout his career:  1) apply state-of-the-art instrumentation to the study of the planets, including Earth; 2) strive to assemble a systematic global planetary climatology — daily global coverage for seasonal and interannual periods; and 3) use these measurements to improve models.  Despite setbacks, he persevered. His own instrument was launched in 2005, and its measurements continue today on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. In various leadership roles, and as JPL’s Chief Scientist, Dan guided scientific pursuits that advanced the careers of over 300 Earth and planetary scientists and astrophysicists.  An internationally known and respected researcher and leader, Dan pursues the goals of Earth and space science at national and international levels. His extraordinary achievements make Daniel J. McCleese a well-deserving recipient of the Nordberg Medal.</p>

                  <h2>Jean-Louis Fellous </h2>
                  <h3>Minor Planet (8617) Fellous</h3>
                  <p>Jean-Louis Fellous has been thoroughly immersed in COSPAR since he delivered his first talk at a science conference, the COSPAR Scientific Assembly in Konstanz, Germany in 1973. In the ensuing years, he took part in and organized many Scientific Assemblies, serving 16 years as a COSPAR officer in Scientific Commission A. In 2008 Jean-Louis was appointed Executive Director, when Roger Bonnet was President, a period that culminated in the Scientific Assembly with the highest attendance, in Bremen in 2010. In Bremen Giovanni Bignami was elected President and delegated to Jean-Louis much responsibility for the operations and new initiatives, including the COSPAR Symposium and the launch of the new journal Life Sciences in Space Research (LSSR). At the Assembly in Moscow in 2014, Len Fisk was elected President, and together they entered into a particularly challenging period for COSPAR. The choice in Moscow of the site for the 2018 Assembly resulted in an initial selection of an unqualified bidder, and Jean-Louis had to coordinate an unprecedented revote by the Council and the selection of Pasadena for the Assembly in 2018. The Assembly in Istanbul scheduled for 2016 had to be cancelled, following waves of terrorism, diminishing attendance, and finally, a military coup. Jean-Louis had to arrange for the extraction from the cancelled Assembly and for all decisions and planning that were to take place at the Assembly to occur by correspondence. The Assembly in Pasadena in 2018 was a great success, new initiatives were taken (e.g., strategic seminar, new panels, newsletter) and with COSPAR no longer in a crisis mode, Jean-Louis could hand over his responsibilities to his worthy successor, Jean-Claude Worms.</p>


                	<h3>Biography</h3>
                  <p>An atmospheric scientist by training, Dr. Jean-Louis Fellous was program manager of the U.S.-French ocean satellite TOPEX-Poseidon launched in 1992. From 1994 to 1998 he promoted international cooperation in global change research between Europe and Africa through the creation of the MEDIAS network. Back at CNES he then led Earth Observation programs until 2001 and oceanic research at IFREMER until 2005.
