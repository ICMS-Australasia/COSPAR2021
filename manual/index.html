                            <p>Please note: your organisation will be responsible for the cost of the booth construction.</p>

                                <li>The structure of the building must remain in the same condition as prior to set-up. Any changes to the building and property of the ICC Sydney will be charged to the company at fault.</li>
                                <li>Any heavy equipment display must be approved before display. Detailed information on dimension and weight to be provided. Please email these through with your custom booth plans.</li>
                                <li>The exhibitor is required to provide the detailed plan</li>
                                <li>Any double storey booth as part of the Engineer Certificate will clearly define the number of occupants allowed taking into account any other item on the second story.</li>
                                <li>Booth dimensions fit the allocated space with sufficient clearance.</li>
                                <li>Materials used for booth construction comply with fire hazard properties set out in the National Construction Code 2016.</li>
                                <li>All materials used for lining, drapes, backdrops, blinds or overhead structures, signs, banners, theming or similar for displays or any part available to the public are to be fire retardant as per the National Construction Code 2016 requirements and other relevant Australian Standards.</li>
                                <li>ICC Sydney will request submission of all information or documentation confirming the retardant capabilities of the materials.</li>
                                <li>Use materials that do not cause dampness, stain, not readily ignitable or capable of emitting toxic fumes in case of ignition.</li>
                                <li>All two storey custom booths will require an engineer’s certification on completion.</li>

                                <li>Ensure all raised floors with a height of less than 115mm have a clearly distinguishable ramped edge.</li>
                                <li>To prevent trip hazards on standard 32mm high raised floors, ramped edging with a gradient no less than 1:3 is generally acceptable in the exhibition industry; however, please note that a 1:3 ramped edge does not constitute a disabled access ramp. For raised floors above 32mm and below 115mm it is recommended that the gradient of the ramped edging be decreased to 1:8.</li>
                                <li>All ramped edges are to be contained within the contracted space.</li>

                            <p>The ICC Loading Dock is managed by the ICC team. Deliveries of any description (including exhibitor goods) must be sent through the preferred freight forwarder or courier.</p>
                            <p>Goods must not be sent to the Loading Dock before the scheduled times for the move-in of your event. All goods must be collected by the end of the official move-out time.</p>
                            <p>ICC Sydney will not sign possession of goods from couriers on behalf of exhibitors. Please ensure you or a representative is on site to accept and sign for deliveries. ICC Sydney takes no responsibility for unattended goods on site and will not sign for exhibitor deliveries; exhibitors are solely responsible for the safety or well-being of any items on, or delivered to, the site if unable to be present and accept deliveries or assign a contractor to do so. Deliveries not through the preferred freight forwarder must be delivered on the exhibitor move in day.</p>
                            <p>ICC Sydney does not have venue storage and is therefore unable to accept freight shipments before schedule move in times. Freight consignment and off-site storage arrangements before, during and after the hiring period are the responsibilities of the event organiser.</p>
