                      <p>This Space Week, 4-10 October 2020, COSPAR-K is encouraging students to explore the ancient ways Aboriginal Australians observed the solar system to better understand and manage our precious natural resources.</p>
                      <p>Students are asked to visually represent their knowledge of Ancient Aboriginal Astronomy and our Solar System in an original piece of artwork. Artwork can be inspired by Aboriginal Australian pieces but must be created by a student, be an original piece and be culturally appropriate.</p>
                      <p>Accompanying this in 50 words or less, please write a short statement about what has inspired the artwork. This will be displayed alongside the winning entries; the judges will also refer to this statement when reviewing entries.</p>

                                <h3>What is COSPAR-K? What is the Connection to Aboriginal Astronomy?</h3>
                                <p>For the first time in its history, the International Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) Scientific Assembly will be hosted in the Southern Hemisphere, in Sydney Australia. COSPAR-K is the STEM Park running alongside The Assembly created specifically for students, teachers and parents.</p>
                                <p>To reflect this auspicious event, COSPAR-K is on the hunt for uniquely Australian imagery to honour this once in a generational experience. We want to see the beauty of our Southern Stars through the eyes of our youth. Taking inspiration from Aboriginal Australians, the world's first Astronomers, we want students to create a unique piece of artwork whilst also learning about the significance of space, stars and planets for the oldest continuing culture.</p>
                                <p>Weâ€™ve partnered with three passionate STEM leaders to bring this competition and prize pack to you. We thank them for their time and expertise; theyâ€™ll also be our superstar judges so check them out below.</p>
