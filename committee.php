                        <p>Fresh out of uni, Imogen Rea (BAeroEng 2019) has landed a position as an Engineer at Geoscience Australia, where she works on the Satellite-Based Augmentation System – technology that enhances the positioning capability of standard global
                            navigation satellite systems.</p>
                        <p>“We’re delivering improved positioning across Australia, with accuracy down to 10 centimetres,” explains Imogen. “This means that your Uber will know what side of the road you’re on. I really enjoy how this project touches every industry and is a
                            platform for Australian innovation.”

                            <p>Prior to her current role, Imogen had worked for a year or so as a Satellite-Based Augmentation System Test-bed Project Coordinator at FrontierSI (formerly the Cooperative Research Centre for Spatial Information), where she worked closely with
                                industry to understand the benefits of the system to Australia and New Zealand. So she had some relevant experience under her belt when she arrived at Geoscience Australia.</p>
                            <p>As a Year 12 student, Imogen attended the National Youth Science Forum and Australian Youth Aerospace Forum. These experiences inspired her to pursue a degree in aerospace engineering. “I was interested in space, and the hands-on element of
                                engineering,” she says. “And through this discipline I’ve learned how to break down and solve complex problems, as well as how to communicate complex ideas to the public.”</p>
                            <p>At uni, Imogen participated in the technical and operations teams of Monash Motorsport, travelling and racing the combustion vehicle in Europe with them. She also served for two years as President of the Australian Youth Aerospace Association,
                                which gave her an opportunity each June to share some lessons learned through university and the space industry with secondary school students in Queensland.</p>
                            <p>“The best thing these groups taught me was how to interact with a multi-disciplinary team – a skill that I’ll continue to build on and carry with me throughout my career,” shares Imogen.</p>
                            <p>Imogen hopes to one day work overseas in the space sector. She would like to then eventually return home with more expertise to contribute to an evolving space industry.</p>
                            <p>What does Imogen recommend to others? “Take every opportunity that comes your way – bite off more than you can chew and then chew like crazy!” she offers. “By doing this, you’ll build a broad network and a diverse skillset.”</p>
