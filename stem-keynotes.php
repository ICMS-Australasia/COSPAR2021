                            <p>Phil Bland is Professor of Space & Planetary Science at Curtin University. He is Director of the Space Science and Technology Centre (SSTC). With 50 students and staff, it is the largest planetary research group in the southern hemisphere. He came to Australia on an ARC Laureate Fellowship in 2012. His research is focused on the origin and evolution of the solar system; how our planet formed; how it acquired the ingredients for life. He has been on multiple planetary mission science teams. In 2006, Asteroid ‘1981 EW21’ was renamed ‘(6580) Philbland’ in recognition of his contributions to space and planetary science. Major projects include the Desert Fireball Network (now expanding into a global facility), which was complemented by the multi-award winning Fireballs in the Sky outreach and citizen science program. In 2015 Bland established a partnership between NASA and Australia in planetary, space and exploration science. Curtin now formally represents the Australian planetary community to NASA. His team have been partnering with Lockheed Martin since 2016, translating DFN technology into applications in space situational awareness, and are now focussing on spacecraft engineering.</p>
                            <p>For all budding planetary geologists or anyone wanting to know how to get an asteroid named after them, Phil’s talk is one to add to the calendar now.</p>
