Adrian’s fields of research include Mars, astrobiology and remote sensing spectroscopy and has a background in computer science and electrical engineering.</p>
                                  <p>Adrian is a fully qualified private pilot and has used this skill to enhance his knowledge of remote sensing by flying over study regions in Western Australia. He holds current endorsements on C172 and Piper Warrior single engine aircraft. He is qualified in remote first aid and as an outback four wheel drive exponent and served with the Royal Australian Navy as a Weapons Engineer and Fire Control Officer on Her Majesty's Australian Ships CANBERRA and ARUNTA, in addition to numerous shore postings around Australia.</p>
                                  <p>Adrian is an Australian citizen, and grew up in Melbourne, Victoria. He is a fan of the Australian Rules football club Essendon, and an avid listener to JJJ and TAL.</p>
                                  <p>He completed his PhD in Earth and Planetary Science at Macquarie University, in Sydney, Australia. The topic of his defence was "Hyperspectral Mapping of Ancient Hydrothermal Systems". His advisors were Prof. Malcolm Walter of the Australian Centre for Astrobiology and Dr. Thomas Cudahy of CSIRO Exploration and Mining in Perth, Western Australia. Further information is available here.</p>
                                  <p>After completing his PhD, Adrian was selected as a 2006 NASA Postdoctoral Scholar at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. Adrian then became a research scientist at the non-profit SETI Institute where he conducted planetary science research, primarily on Mars using the CRISM instrument on NASA's MRO spacecraft. While at the SETI Institute, Adrian ran the research and public SETI Seminar series and was the program chief for the SETICON II convention.</p>
                                  <p>In 2015, Adrian moved to the East Coast and has since taken up his current role at NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C.</p>

                                  <p>Phil Bland is Professor of Space & Planetary Science at Curtin University. He is Director of the Space Science and Technology Centre (SSTC). With 50 students and staff, it is the largest planetary research group in the southern hemisphere. He came to Australia on an ARC Laureate Fellowship in 2012. His research is focused on the origin and evolution of the solar system; how our planet formed; how it acquired the ingredients for life. He has been on multiple planetary mission science teams. In 2006, Asteroid ‘1981 EW21’ was renamed ‘(6580) Philbland’ in recognition of his contributions to space and planetary science. Major projects include the Desert Fireball Network (now expanding into a global facility), which was complemented by the multi-award winning Fireballs in the Sky outreach and citizen science program. In 2015 Bland established a partnership between NASA and Australia in planetary, space and exploration science. Curtin now formally represents the Australian planetary community to NASA. His team have been partnering with Lockheed Martin since 2016, translating DFN technology into applications in space situational awareness and are now focussing on spacecraft engineering.</p>
                                  <p>For all budding planetary geologists or anyone wanting to know how to get an asteroid named after them, Phil’s talk is one to add to the calendar now.</p>

He is the Director of Saber Astronautics Australia and is kept busy with space mission operations, ground stations, democratisation of space and open source hardware, as well as currently building the nation's space Mission Control Centre, in Adelaide, SA.</p>
                                  <p>Prior to Saber, Andreas created and ran a start-up, Obelisk Systems which developed next-generation CubeSat hardware, both for educational and commercial environments. This led to the development of the STEM education platform StarLAB which was a platform catered to high school students, ensuring they received the best in coding, hardware, sensing and robotics education to skill them for the rapidly evolving world.</p>
                                  <p>His presentation is a must-see for all aspiring Astronautic Engineers!</p>

                                  <h4>Innovation in Education with Space Exploration</h4>
                                  <p>Rosa will present a series of innovative models for the integration of Space Exploration in classrooms. The main objective is to invite the audience to think outside the box and reinvent education, not as a pre-designed journey, pre-established for what is perceived as the average student, but as an individual path, <b>co-designed</b> and uniquely embraced by each individual learner.</p>
                                  <p>She will share a series of best practices for innovation in education along with concrete examples for its integration in the classroom.</p>
                                  <p>Space as an engine to gather enthusiasm for the STEAM domain and will be used to provide concrete ideas on how to integrate these in a classroom settings using proven examples. The main aim is to invite participants to rethink their perceived notions of what is the importance of school in our lives and the urgent transformation required to transform classrooms into bed tests for the future generations of this planet's leaders. The role of institutions that ultimately have in their hands the future of Earth and its inhabitants.</p>
