                              <p>With an avid interest in science, Corey started the Deadly Science initiative in 2018 and has incredibly distributed over 11,000 books, 480 telescopes plus other many other resources to over 105 schools with no plan of slowing down soon.</p>
                              <p>Deadly Science aims to provide early reading materials, science books and connect young Indigenous people with mentors to encourage their participation in STEM subjects across all of Australia, no matter how remote. Deadly Science wants to ensure all schools have access to our history of science by providing First Nations resources to connect back to our First Scientists; after all Indigenous Australian’s were the first Astronomers and are the oldest continuing culture in the world.</p>
                              <p>We can’t wait to hear Corey share his story and inspire the next generation of STEM superstars.</p>

                              <p>Welcoming Andreas Antoniades as the second Keynote Speaker to be confirmed for COSPAR-K. Andreas is passionate about developing engineering solutions to real-world problems, particularly for space and ensuring that these solutions are available and affordable to all. He is the Director of Saber Astronautics Australia and is kept busy with space mission operations, ground stations, democratisation of space and open source hardware, as well as currently building the nation's space Mission Control Centre, in Adelaide, SA.</p>
                              <p>Prior to Saber, Andreas created and ran a start-up, Obelisk Systems which developed next-generation CubeSat hardware, both for educational and commercial environments. This led to the development of the STEM education platform StarLAB which was a platform catered to high school students, ensuring they received the best in coding, hardware, sensing and robotics education to skill them for the rapidly evolving world. His presentation is a must-see for all aspiring Astronautic Engineers!</p>
