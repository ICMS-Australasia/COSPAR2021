        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Registration Rates</h2>
        <p>The early bird rate will be extended to the end of December 2020 and of most importance to presenters at COSPAR-2021-Hybrid, a further-reduced registration fee is available for those presenters who comply with the request to submit their
          pre-recorded contributions by the end of November. Submitting pre-recorded contributions in time to obtain the reduced rate will allow the organizers of COSPAR-2021-Hybrid to populate the on-line platform for seamless content delivery
          before 28 January 2021.</p>
        <p>A discounted “Presenters Early Bird Rate” has been introduced, that will expire at the end of November 2020. Access to this new rate will be triggered by upload of the presenter’s pre-recordings prior to the end of November. Students,
          Early Career Researchers and Retirees can immediately access the discounted Early Bird rates for their category, which are already significantly below the Presenter Early Bird Rate</p>
        <p>Please note we only <strong>accept payment in Australian dollars</strong>. International rates are provided only as an indication.</p>
