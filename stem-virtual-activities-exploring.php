                      <p>Praxical is offering two different virtual experiences during COSPAR-K.</p>

                      <p><b>1.  LIVE:</b> <br>
                        Praxical co-founders and presenters, Bonnie Teece and Luke Steller, will lead an interactive workshop based on Praxical’s Exploring Habitable Worlds workshop.</p>

                      <p>In this interactive workshop, you can make predictions as to how planetary conditions (i.e. a planets size, distance from its star and the type of star it orbits around) can affect its potential habitably. You will vote to make predictions, along with have the opportunity to ask questions to astrobiologists Luke and Bonnie.</p>
