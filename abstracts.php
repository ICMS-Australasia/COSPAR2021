<h2 class="mb-4">COSPAR 2021 Scientific Assembly Program Announcement</h2>
<img src="img/logo-co2.jpg" class="float-right mt-4 ml-md-4 mb-md-4" width="160" alt="">

                            <h3>Space research colleagues,</h3>


<p>The Program Committee for COSPAR 2020 have now finalized the COSPAR Assembly Program, with more than 3000 abstracts assigned to sessions. This program will be the baseline Program for COSPAR 2021, with the same sessions, organized in the same chronological order, taking place in the same assigned rooms at the International Convention Centre in Sydney during the week of <strong>Thursday 28 January to Thursday 4 February 2021</strong>.</p>

<p>The opportunity to submit new abstracts or update existing abstracts will be available in the coming months.</p>
<p>Allowances for adequate time to meet the Early Bird registration date of 31 October 2020  will be considered. All announcements will be made on the COSPAR 2021 website and COSPAR 2021 e-zines.</p>

<p>Registrations already submitted for the COSPAR 2020 Assembly are immediately applicable to COSPAR 2021, as are the hotel bookings that have been secured through the Local Organising Committee.</p>
<p>The early-bird registration deadline for COSPAR 2021 is now 31 October 2020.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
