        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">The Basics for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid</h2>
        <ul class="alpha list-space">
          <li>The Scientific Program (dates, sessions and selected contributions) that was initially released for COSPAR 2020 and then transplanted to 2021 is the Scientific Program for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid.</li>
          <li>Existing abstracts in the Scientific Program can be updated and the program can expand with new abstracts and presenters.</li>
          <li>The current challenges will be viewed as opportunities to innovate and demonstrate the art of the possible for large gatherings in the new world we find ourselves in.</li>
          <li>COSPAR-2021-Hybrid will contribute to COSPAR’s mission by bringing the space research community together to connect, share, partner and grow, evermore successfully.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">COSPAR-2021-Hybrid, a true global Assembly</h2>

        <p>The following are the activities and actions that will occur to deliver a Scientific Program for COSPAR-2021-Hybrid that can be enjoyed, with active participation, worldwide. These activities and actions apply to the Scientific Program,
          which was established for COSPAR-2021, when it was postponed from COSPAR 2020. There is no change in the program (themes, sessions, layout), now that COSPAR-2021 is COSPAR-2021-Hybrid. </p>

        <ul class="list-space">
          <li><strong>The abstract submission portal will be re-opened after release of this document</strong>, to allow authors whose content may have evolved in the period of the delay from 2020 to 2021 to update their abstracts, subject to
            maintaining the essential theme of the presentation and relevance to the Event in which they have already been scheduled.</li>
          <li><strong>An opportunity to submit new abstracts to the existing program will be provided</strong> in order to allow the members of the community previously unable to attend Sydney in 2020 in-person to now participate in the global
            COSPAR-2021-Hybrid event. After new abstracts are submitted, the relevant MSO and DO and the Program Committee will review the abstracts and determine how they can be accommodated within the existing program, or, given the flexibility
            that is provided by a hybrid Assembly, whether an extension of the Event or an additional Event is required.</li>
          <li><strong>The delivery of posters will be handled virtually</strong>, in a similar manner to the oral presentations, but maintaining a sense of the atmosphere of poster session gatherings.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Each poster presentation will be pre-recorded in the short summary form, including a single-slide version of the poster itself.</li>
            <li>The pre-recording and slide will be available via the platform throughout the Assembly.</li>
            <li>On the relevant day for each programmed poster session, those sessions will be delivered virtually following the three-hour oral blocks.</li>
            <li>The platform will present to the delegates the full array of posters for that session as thumbnails of each slide.</li>
            <li>Clicking on a poster thumbnail will stream the summary presentation for that poster, while an adjacent link will take the delegate into a unique live break-out room with the poster presenter and other interested delegates, and
              interaction with the presenter and amongst those other delegates will be enabled.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>The on-line platform, which will be available to both in-person and virtual participants</strong>, will include personalised tailoring options to highlight to each participant the content and the other participants and
            participating organisations that might be of specific relevance and interest to them and enable direct connections to be easily made. With the use of the platform, the ‘corridor conversations’ that are so valuable for building
            relationship and partnership will be enabled – assisted by virtual meeting rooms - and in fact enhanced.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Interdisciplinary Lectures, cross-disciplinary workshops and Assembly-wide events</h2>

        <p>An outstanding selection of speakers from across the globe will deliver Interdisciplinary Lectures through the on-line platform. All Interdisciplinary Lectures will be live streamed and feature live moderated Q&A to ensure maximum benefit
          to the COSPAR scientific community. These Interdisciplinary Lectures will occur prior to the commencement of the main Programming to ensure maximum participation, each day, and also be available as on-demand content. Cross-disciplinary
          workshops, panel events, and public lectures will also be a highlight on the on-line platform.</p>
