                      <h3>Paint the Sky - A Lesson in Ancient Aboriginal Astronomy</h3>

                      <p>During Space Week, 4-10 October 2020, COSPAR-K encouraged students to explore the ancient ways Aboriginal Australians observed the solar system to better understand and manage our precious natural resources.</p>
                      <p>Students were asked to visually represent their knowledge of Ancient Aboriginal Astronomy and our Solar System in an original piece of artwork. Artwork were inspired by Aboriginal Australian pieces but had to be created by a student, be an original piece and be culturally appropriate.</p>
                      <p>Accompanying this in 50 words or less, students wrote a short statement about what inspired the artwork. The descriptions and all 843 artworks can be seen in the Student Art Gallery at the top of the page.</p>
                      <p>There were 20 winners awarded the awesome prize pack. The prize pack contained:</p>
